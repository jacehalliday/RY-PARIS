        "No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are juicy, and spices can be
        easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. Baste frequently with
        your favorite barbeque sauce. If you find the meat mixture too mushy,
        just add more bread crumbs until it forms patties that hold their
        shape."

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>24 ounces ground chuck</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1/2 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
          <li>1 large egg</li>
          <li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
          <li>4 hamburger buns, split and toasted</li>
          <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
          <li>4 slices tomato</li>
          <li>4 slices red onion</li>
          <li>Ketchup, mustard and/or mayonnaise (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h6 class="spice-mix">Spice Mix</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="directions">
        <h5>Directions</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat, ensuring the
            grates are clean and lightly oiled to prevent sticking. If using a
            charcoal grill, allow the coals to become ashy and spread them
            evenly for consistent heat. For a gas grill, close the lid and let
            it heat for at least 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, add the ground chuck. Sprinkle in the kosher
            salt and freshly ground black pepper to season the meat. Add the
            plain bread crumbs, which will help bind the mixture and keep the
            burgers juicy. Crack the large egg into the bowl, then add the
            finely chopped onion and Worcestershire sauce for extra flavor.
            Finally, add all the spice mix ingredients: ground cumin, ground
            coriander, ground turmeric, and chili powder. Use clean hands or a
            fork to gently combine all ingredients, being careful not to
            overwork the meat, as this can make the burgers tough.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Once the ingredients are just combined, divide the mixture into four
            equal portions. To ensure even cooking, use a kitchen scale if
            available. Shape each portion into a patty about 3/4-inch thick,
            pressing gently to form a uniform shape. Make a slight indentation
            in the center of each patty with your thumb; this helps the burgers
            cook evenly and prevents them from puffing up in the middle.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Place the patties onto the preheated grill or grill pan. Cook for
            approximately 6-7 minutes on the first side without moving them,
            allowing a nice crust to form. Flip each patty carefully using a
            spatula and continue cooking for another 6-7 minutes, or until the
            internal temperature reaches 160°F for well-done burgers. Adjust the
            cooking time for your preferred doneness.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            While the burgers are grilling, baste each patty frequently with
            your favorite barbeque sauce using a brush. This adds flavor and
            helps keep the burgers moist. Apply the sauce after flipping and
            again just before removing the patties from the grill.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Split the hamburger buns and place them cut-side down on the grill
            for 1-2 minutes, or until they are lightly browned and toasted.
            Watch closely to avoid burning. Toasting the buns adds texture and
            helps prevent them from becoming soggy when assembled.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            To assemble the burgers, place a toasted bun bottom on each plate.
            Add a lettuce leaf, followed by a grilled patty. Top each patty with
            a slice of tomato and a slice of red onion. If desired, add
            additional toppings such as pickles or cheese.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Finish by spreading ketchup, mustard, and/or mayonnaise on the top
            half of each bun according to your preference. Place the bun tops
            over the assembled burgers.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Serve the Bengal Burgers immediately while hot. Pair with your
            favorite sides such as fries, chips, or a fresh salad. Enjoy the
            juicy, flavorful burgers with friends and family!
